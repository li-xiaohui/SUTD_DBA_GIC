# Investment Insights with NLP
 
 This is a repository for the <i>40.011 : Data and Business Analytics Project</i>, in collaboration with GIC to build a data pipeline that would gather consumer sentiment on various products.

## Project Flow

1. Data Collection: Web-scraping of popular e-commerce websites, to build a corpus of product reviews. 
2. Topic Modelling: Building a topic model, using various topic modelling algorithms, trained with the corpus we have built.

## Prerequisites

The script is tested on Python 3.6.5  
Install the following libraries on your system, in order for the code to run. 

1. pandas==0.23.0
2. requests==2.18.4
3. nltk==3.3
4. lxml==4.2.1
5. gensim==3.6.0
6. beautifulsoup4==4.6.3
7. scikit_learn==0.20.0

Alternatively, pip install the requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1.Data Collection

The main script that triggers the Data Collection process is ```scrape_main.py```. 

```scrape_main.py``` takes in ```SEARCH TERM``` as a keyword, and will initialize the scrapping process from the following websites:

1. Amazon (All reviews from the first page of the website's search result)
2. Best Buy
3. Walmart

The default keyword for ```SEARCH TERM``` is ```coffee machine```. 
Change ```coffee machine``` to whatever you would like to scrape.

Scraping process will take ~1 hour, depending on how much there is to scrape.

#### Expected Output:

An excel file labelled 'Customer Reviews of <i>SEARCH TERM</i>.xlsx' will be downloaded to your system.

### 2.Topic Modelling

This script will take in the output of ```scrape_main.py```, and generate topic models. 
These topic models consists of a certain number of words that probably make up a topic.
We use three different algorithms to produce the topic models:

1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) <i>Blei, David M.; Ng, Andrew Y.; Jordan, Michael I (January 2003)</i>

2. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

3. k-means Clustering

Topic modelling process will take 5-10 min, depending on how much data there is to process.

#### Expected Output

3 different excel files, labelled 'K Means Topic Model.xlsx', 'LDA Topic Model.xlsx', 'LSA Topic Model.xlsx', will be downloaded to your system. Each excel file contains a number of words generated by the algorithm that most likely form a topic, sorted by brand.
